<p style="text-align: justify;"> Developing a Hydrodynamic-Hydrologic (H-H) data assimilation framework for probabilistic flood inundation mapping during Hurricane Harvey in the San Jacinto watershed in Texas. In this work, We integrated LISFLOOD-FP hydrodynamic model with the EnKF data assimilation approach. Link to <a href=" https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/25/4995/2021/">paper</a><br><br>
