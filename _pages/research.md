My research focuses on leveraging machine learning, data assimilation, and hydrologic modeling to improve the accuracy and reliability of land surface and hydrologic model estimates. I use a variety of resources, including in-situ measurements, reanalysis data, and satellite products, to enhance drought monitoring and forecasting, flood forecasting and inundation likelihood mapping, and other environmental early warning systems.
