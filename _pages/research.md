My research interests involve hydrologic science/water resources system analysis and computational modeling with an emphasis on predictive science, uncertainty analysis, data analytics, and high-performance computing. My research in general focuses on advancing our understanding of the interactions between climate, hydrology, and water resources using the data sets and methods including, machine learning, remote sensing, state-of-the-art data assimilation, Bayesian inference, distributed hydrologic modeling, ensemble inference, post-processing, and multi-modeling. My diverse background and contribution to engineering projects have provided me with a broad overview of climate-water interactions and motivated me to seek solutions in a multidisciplinary manner by bridging the fields of engineering, statistics, and data science. This page gives a brief overview of past research efforts and summarizes my current research directions.<br><br>

Below is the summary of some of the projects that I worked on in collaboration with Ph.D. students, postdocs, faculties, and scientists from multiple departments (i.e., Civil and Environmental Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics, Geography, Geological Sciences, and Biological Sciences) and national agencies (i.e., NASA and NOAA).<br><br>
