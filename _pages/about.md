I am an Assistant Professor and Director of [Computational Hydrology and Intelligence Laboratory](xx) in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Portland State University. 

Prior to this, I held a postdoctoral research associate position at the [Integrated Groundwater Modeling Center](https://igwmc.princeton.edu) in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Princeton University, working with [Prof. Reed Maxwell](http://maxwell.princeton.edu). I also served as a science collaborator in the [Hydrological Sciences Laboratory of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center](https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/sed/bio/108710/). I hold a PhD in Civil and Environmental Engineering from the University of Alabama, working with [Prof. Hamid Moradkhani](https://moradkhani.ua.edu) at [Center for Complex Hydrosystems Research](https://cchr.eng.ua.edu).
