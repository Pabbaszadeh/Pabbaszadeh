I am currently a postdoctoral research associate working with [Prof. Reed Maxwell](http://maxwell.princeton.edu) at the Integrated Groundwater Modeling Center in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Princeton University. I am also serving as a science collaborator in the [Hydrological Sciences Laboratory of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center](https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/sed/bio/108710/). I hold a PhD in Civil and Environmental Engineering from University of Alabama, working with [Prof. Hamid Moradkhani](https://moradkhani.ua.edu).

My research focuses on leveraging machine learning, data assimilation, and hydrologic modeling while using a variety of resources including in-situ, reanalysis, and satellite products to improve the accuracy and reliability of land surface and hydrologic model estimates, which results in enhancing drought monitoring and forecasting, flood forecasting and inundation likelihood mapping, and other environmental early warning systems.
